/**
 * <p>
 * Package containing resources for gRPC communication with the <em>Data Platform</em>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The resources here support gRPC communications common to all API library systems.
 * Most notable are the support for gRPC <code>ManagedChannel</code> objects and their
 * creation and configuration.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This package also depends, in part, upon the <code>dp-grpc</code> project
 * which supports external communications with the <em>Data Platform</em>. 
 * Communications with the <em>Data Platform</em> is done exclusively
 * through gRPC and Protobuf messaging.
